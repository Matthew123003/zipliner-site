We've wanted to have a social network of Zip Code alumnae. BUT, We have always been stymied by _Yeah, but what should it do?_

## ZipLiner

ZipLiner is mean as place to figure out what would a social network by and for Zip Coders (and their fans) look like? 
What do you want from such a platform?

## What "apps" should ZipLiner provide?

- How about a blogging platform that allows members to share cool tech and ideas?
- What about a micro-blogging linkage to something like BlueSky or Mastodon?
- What about places to share Zip Coders and their passion projects?
- Would a _stack overflow_ lke community be worth it?
